# PosUi

PosUi is a Point of Sale (POS) system built with Angular. This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing sales transactions in retail environments. Users can browse available products, add items to their shopping cart, select product variants (such as size or color), enter customer information, calculate prices with tiered pricing support, and process payments through a modal interface.

The system includes key components like a product list, shopping cart with line items, customer form, payment modal, and variant selection modal. It utilizes modern Angular features such as signals for reactive state management and can be extended with backend integrations for inventory and payment processing.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
